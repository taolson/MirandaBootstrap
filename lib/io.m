|| a wrapper on a byteStream# (which is just a word# that represents the raw heapAddr of an allocated byteStream#)
|| which allows for top-level handle thunks like stdin
handle ::= Handle word#

io * == state () *

|| Note: the following routines are written with an explicit state "world" argument, rather than partially-
|| applied with an implicit state, because they don't rely upon the sequencing inherent in the state
|| operations, but rather have a chain of case statements which handle strict evaluation of primitive
|| operations.  However, we need to ensure that the state "world" is available before performing the
|| case operations, so world is an explicit argument which is simply passed in, then returned at the end.
|| Also, since the compiler inliner explicitly avoids inlining any function in this module, they
|| don't benefit from being written in partially-applied form to aid with inlining.
