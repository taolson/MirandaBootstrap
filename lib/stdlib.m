 %export + -null -unsafeWriteStdErr     || null defined in mirandaExtensions, but defined and used internally, here, to avoid dependency


|| Note on unboxed primitive values:
|| unboxed primitive values (word#) cannot be passed in to polymorphic functions, stored in polymorphic data structures, or bound to a variable using
|| a let{rec} (i.e. defined in a where clause), because those assume that the value is boxed.

|| Note on functions written with partial application
|| Many functions here are written with partial application -- fewer arguments than full saturation would dictate. Thes return
|| a function to take the rest of the arguments.  This is done mostly to allow better inlining optimization with recursive functions,
|| since it splits the function into a non-recursive part, which can be inlined, and a recursive part, which cannot.  The non-recursive
|| part can be used during inlining and optimization to specialize the recursive loop.  In other cases, the function is written with
|| its most "natural" arity, i.e. the arity that it is typically called with.  Note, however, that top-level functions should have at
|| least one argument, otherwise they become Constant Applicative Form thunks, which have to be updated during execution, and also
|| generate less efficient code.

|| Typeclasses
|| Miranda has a "magic" polymorphic implementation of comparison operators and the "show" function, and
|| its implementation uses runtime tags to determine the actual comparison operation.  Miranda2 does not use
|| runtime tags, so an ord instance must be explicitly passed in to any function performing comparisons.  Currently
|| Miranda2 does not implement true typeclasses, so this is handled manually.  Types defined with ::= or == have
|| ord and show instances automatically derived by the compiler, but can be overriden with explicit definitions.


|| show typeclass

|| a showI is an instance of a show typeclass: a function for converting the value to a string
showI * == * -> string

|| show turns a show instance into a string
show :: showI * -> * -> string
show si x = si x

|| show instance for word#
showword# :: showI word#
showword# w = showint (I# w) ++ "#"

|| show instance for unit
showunit :: showI ()
showunit _ = "()"

|| show instance for function
showFn :: showI (* -> **)
showFn f = "<function>"


|| ord typeclass

ordering ::= EQ | LT | GT

|| an ordI is an instance of an ord typeclass: a function for comparing two values
|| and returning an ordering
ordI * == * -> * -> ordering

|| sequence ordering comparisons, used in deriving an ord instance for complex data
thenCmp :: ordering -> ordering -> ordering
thenCmp a b
    = case a of
        EQ -> b
        LT -> LT
        GT -> GT

|| get the tag value for a constructor, useful for implementing enums
getTag :: * -> int
getTag c = case c of _ -> case getTag# c of t -> I# t

|| compare the tags of two constructor applications
|| c1 and c2 must evaluate to fully-saturated constructors
|| used by compiler in deriving an ord instance for user data
|| Note: the use of wildcards instead of variables in the caseAlts
|| is to avoid generation of extraneous Vclosure creation, since we
|| don't need the whole closure value, just the tag part
cmpTags :: * -> * -> ordering
cmpTags c1 c2
    = case c1 of
        _ -> case getTag# c1 of
                 t1 -> case c2 of

|| ord instance for function (cannot compare)

|| all ord operations are derived from the ord instance (ordI *)
compare :: ordI * -> * -> * -> ordering
compare cmp a b = cmp a b

|| note: these are partially-applied with only the first value to compare, to allow better
|| inlining for presection/postsection use as in filter
_eq, _ne, _lt, _le, _gt, _ge :: ordI * -> * -> * -> bool

|| error handling and debugging
|| these perform unsafe IO operations, but we don't want to have a module
|| dependency on IO, so we use a local unsafeWriteStdErr function

|| exit the program with an int result status

|| write a string to stderr (simple version that doesn't depend upon the io module, but can result in out-of-order io)

|| readByteStream# returns (-1)# at end of stream
readByteStream :: word# -> string

    = case readByteStream# s# of

                _  -> C# c# : readByteStream s#

|| write a string to a byteStream, returning any unwritten portion of the string if the byteStream becomes full
writeByteStream :: word# -> string -> string
writeByteStream s# [] = []
writeByteStream s# (C# c# : cs)
    = case writeByteStream# s# c# of 
        0# -> writeByteStream s# cs     || return of 0# indicates write was successful

|| standard function combinators

id :: * -> *
id x = x

|| note: const is not written with partial application, here, even though it is normally called with

|| code growth (e.g. lens.set)

|| note: converse is partially-applied here with f and the first argument expected, since that is the

|| standard string functions

string == [char]

|| show instance for string, defined explicitly here to show the (escaped) string in quotes, rather than
|| as a list of individual chars, as its default derived instance would
showstring :: showI string
showstring s = "\"" ++ foldr showsc "\"" s where showsc c = (showCharUnquoted c ++)

|| define some standard comparison operators for string
|| note: these are partially applied here, expecting only the first argument, to match the arity of the
|| _eq, _ne ... functions.  Explicit eta-conversion for the first parameter is not performed, otherwise
|| the functions would become top-level CAFs which would require updates at runtime
(==$) a = _eq cmpstring a
(~=$) a = _ne cmpstring a
(<$)  a = _lt cmpstring a
(<=$) a = _le cmpstring a
(>$)  a = _gt cmpstring a
(>=$) a = _ge cmpstring a
