|| memoize a function on an int
memoint :: (int -> *) -> (int -> *)
memoint f = memo id id f

|| memoize a function on a char
memochar :: (char -> *) -> (char -> *)
memochar f = memo code decode f

|| memoize a function on a tuple, given the memoizers for the tuple elements
|| by chaining the memoizers for the product type (a, b), providing a trie of tries
|| the type signature for this function isn't defined, here, because it is hard to write
memopair mA mB f = uncurry . mA $ mB . curry f

|| memoize a function on a list, given the memoizer for a list element by
|| chaining a sequence of memoizers to provided a nested trie structure
|| the type signature for this function isn't defined, here, because it is hard to write
