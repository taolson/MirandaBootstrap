|| subMin.m -- demonstration of finding the minimum value in a list and subtracting it
||             from all the elements in the list in a single pass
||
|| Normally this operation would be written in two passes of the list: the first to
|| find the minimum value, and the second to subtract that from all the elements.
|| However, in a lazily-evaluated language, this is possible to do in a single pass by
|| "tying the knot": in this case, refering to the final, but still-to-be computed value
|| "min" within the code that is simultaneously computing the min and subtracting it.
|| As long as the reference to "min" is lazy, it will not be evaluated until it is demanded,
|| in this case, when the final list is printed to the output.

|| find the minimum value of a list of ints and subtract that from each element in the list
subMin :: [int] -> [int]
subMin xs
    = xs'
      where
        || mapAccumL maps a function and an accumulator over a list
        || returning the final accumulator and the mapped list
        || in this case, the accumulator value is the current min value
        (min, xs') = mapAccumL tally (hd xs) xs

        || the tally function simultaneously computes a new min value and
        || subtracts the final min value from the element
        tally min' x = (min2 cmpint min' x, x - min)

main = subMin [-50 .. 50] |> showlist showint |> putStrLn
